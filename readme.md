# Dots Game (Machine Learning)
[Game info, rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_(game)

#### Uses:
- [p5](https://p5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)


### Project Goals

1. Project to learn [multi agent reinforcement learning](), that is an intermediate goal
    to create an **automated level creator**
1. Become more accustomed to python
1. Analyze existing ML framework (PyTorch) to get some insight into
    professionally implemented ML API
1. Learn more about ML in general, and even more about related topics

### Finished because:

Run out of time. Could not reach all project goals. 

### Results

#### Successes

1. Implemented game mechanics in python
1. Visualized using p5
1. Learned basics of PyTorch, implemented simple NN and (i guess?) somehow trained it
1. Learned a lot about reinforcement learning, deep q-learning and also some relevant information

#### Failures and Improvements

1. Learning python took much more time then expected

    Different language requires different approaches, that just take way too much time to learn
    Also, in the domain of ML, it takes much more effort to find an answer to a concrete problem
    
    *Improve with:* **more practice**
     
1. Implementing Game mechanics took much more time, then expected (~80% total project time)

    And the game was still buggy and caused program to crash, that just didn't let me do any learning
    of ML algorithms, PyTorch etc.
    
    Fixing those bugs would just take me even more time
    
    *Improve with:* **better search for existing projects**, **better testing**, **more python practice**
    
1. Insufficient background into data science, ML

    I did not feel like I understood **a lot** of what was going on behind high-level PyTorch API,
    and also took a lot of time
    
    *Improve with*: **reading scientific papers**, **watching more tutorials**, **taking on-line courses**
    
1. Wasted a lot of time on setting up development environments
    
    *Improve with*: **doing project planning**
        
    - At the start of the project, set goals and plan implementation.
    - When planning, devote time to setting up development environment,
    so that setting up was only done once.
